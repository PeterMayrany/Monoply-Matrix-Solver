# Monoply-Matrix-Solver
A simple program I developed for my Higher Level IB Math IA.  The program runs for a specified number of iterations, where it multiplies the initial state vector with the transition matrix in the initial iteration, then it multiplies the result with the transition matrix again and so on until the iterations are done and the probabilities are stabilized
